Aim:

The aim of this project is to design and simulate a smart IoT-based energy management system in Cisco Packet Tracer that charges a battery using renewable solar energy and automatically controls the connected devices based on the available energy.

Problem Statement:

The rising global demand for electricity and the depletion of fossil fuel resources have created a need for renewable energy solutions. Solar energy is one of the most promising alternatives; however, efficient utilization of solar energy requires intelligent systems that can monitor power levels and manage loads accordingly. Without automation, excess energy may be wasted, and low-energy conditions may lead to device failures.
This project attempts to solve this problem by simulating a solar panel system that charges a virtual battery and controls a connected light source based on the solar power availability. The simulation demonstrates how IoT-based conditional automation can optimize energy usage in smart homes and industrial applications.

Scope of the Solution

* Can be extended to smart homes, where devices such as lights, fans, and appliances are controlled automatically based on renewable energy availability.
* Can be implemented in industrial IoT applications, where machines can be scheduled to operate when solar energy is sufficient, reducing dependency on grid electricity.
* Provides a low-cost training model for students and researchers to understand IoT automation, renewable energy integration, and smart power management.
* Can be combined with cloud-based IoT dashboards to monitor energy usage remotely and make data-driven decisions.

Required Components

Software/IDE:

Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.2.2 or higher)
Optional: GitHub (for documentation and version control)
Hardware (Simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer):
Solar Panel – Generates energy (Wh values).
Battery/Light Device – Acts as the load consuming solar energy.
Home Gateway (DLC100) – Connects IoT devices and enables remote monitoring.
Tablet/PC – Used to configure IoT conditions and monitor energy status.
IoT Server (inbuilt in Packet Tracer) – Used for automation and condition-based control.

Simulated Circuit Explanation

The simulation is designed in Cisco Packet Tracer as follows:

A Solar Panel generates variable energy (measured in Wh).
A Light (IoT device) is connected via the Home Gateway to represent the energy-consuming load.
A Tablet PC is used to access the IoT server and define automation conditions.

The following conditions are programmed:
If solar status is 0–10 Wh, the light turns OFF (battery too low).
If solar status is 11–50 Wh, the light is set to DIM (battery partially charged).
If solar status is above 50 Wh, the light turns ON fully (battery sufficiently charged).
